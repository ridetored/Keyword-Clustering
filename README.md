# Keyword Clustering with NLP and KMeans

This Python script clusters keywords based on their semantic similarity using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **KMeans clustering**. It utilizes Spacy's word embeddings to understand the context of each keyword and groups similar ones into specified clusters.

---

## Features
- **NLP Integration**: Uses pre-trained Spacy models for semantic analysis.
- **Scalable Clustering**: Supports customizable cluster sizes via KMeans.
- **Exportable Results**: Outputs clusters in a CSV file for further analysis.
